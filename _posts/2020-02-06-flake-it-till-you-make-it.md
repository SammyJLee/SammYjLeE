# Markdown Tasks

Your task here is to create a Markdown file which contains all the information below

Once you have created the file, use [the Mardkdown to pdf converter](https://www.markdowntopdf.com/) to save the file as a pdf. Upload both the markdown file and the pdf output to the Learning Hub Assignments Section.

## Task 1: Create a Second Level Heading Titled Famous Quotes

In this section, find two quotes from [this quotation website](https://www.brainyquote.com/topics) and do the following:

1. Introduce the quote
2. Use a link to the website somewhere in the introduction
2. Use the blockquote feature to show the quote
3. Place a horizontal line between the two quotes

Here is my example:  

## Famous Quotes

This first quote from [Steven Wright](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/steven_wright_128218?src=t_time), a silly comedian, mulls on the concept of time:

>I went to a restaurant that serves 'breakfast at any time'. So I ordered French Toast during the Renaissance.

---
This second quote, from yet another absurdist comedian - Spike Milligan -  reminds me of my [dear old dad](https://www.brainyquote.com/topics/dad-quotes).

>My Father had a profound influence on me. He was a lunatic.

## Task 2: Insert an image of an animal you like

1. Create a second level heading
2. Introduce the image with why you like the animal. 
3. Add alt-text for accessibility.

## Dogs and me

I had a dog for all of my life until I left home. I remember all of them fondly, especially the one below, which I could ride. It wasn't easy in a small house with five kids and this beast.

## Task 3: Create a Table

Create a second level heading called "Tables are Fun"

> **Note**: The table should be the same as the one below, and you must insert the simplified version of the text on the left. The simplified version must be in *italics*.

The first simplified version has been done for you. 


Text | Simplified Text (*In Italics*)
-----|----------------
Due to the fact that | *because*
In the event that | *Insert your answer here*
At this point in time | *insert your answer here*
Obtain | *insert your answer here*
Subsequent| *insert your answer here*
In the vicinity of | *insert your answer here*

## Task 4: Simplify these Phrases and Use Inline Code

Create a level 3 heading please, title "Conciseness Helps Web Readers"

Add an introductory phrase which states why you as a web reader expcet simple, concise writing.

Turn a sentence like this: 

Our Web site has made available many of the things you can use for making a decision on the best dentist.

into this: 

`Our website presents criteria for determining the best dentist.`

Thanks to the [Online Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/conciseness/index.html) for this example.

Here are the two sample sentences for you to make more concise. Remember the inline code for your answer.

>At this point in time we can't ascertain the reason as to why the screen door was left open.

> There is a desire on the part of many of us to maintain a spring break for the purpose of getting away from the demands of our studies.

## Task 5: Nearing the End: Generating Code Blocks

Markdown allows you to create code blocks that can either look like this: 

```
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";
```

or with the highlighted elements like this this:
```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";
```
Please create a second level heading titled "Code Blocks Make Me Happy"

Introduce two code blocks for two different langauges by stating what the code does.

For each code block, make sure to use the formatting for that code, as in the second example above. Markdown does this for you.

Add a final statement in bold that states your current desire to finish this activity. Here is my example: 

**I am SO done.**
