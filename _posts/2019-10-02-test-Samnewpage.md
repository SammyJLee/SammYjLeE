This post focuses on my attempts to use markdown to create a Jekyll based static site hosted on Github.

## A little background: let's start with why

My goals in learning markdown stem from my desire to get CST and FSWD students to create writing that can appear in their Github. Why even bother? 

Well, students are expected to add their Github link on their resumes. This way, employers can see student project work, specifically their codes, comments, and contributions. This access to student code allows for a more in-depth understanding of the technical skills a student possesses. Cool, right? But what about their non-technical (old skool soft skills) skills? That's the stuff I teach. Let me explain. 

On every job description, we can see these bullets:
> must have excellent oral and written communication skills.
