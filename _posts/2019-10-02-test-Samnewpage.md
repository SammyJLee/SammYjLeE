I'll focus on my attempts to use markdown to create a Jekyll-based static site hosted on Github so that I can teach my post-secondary students to do the same. Come walk with me on my journey into insanity.

## A little background: let's start with why

My goals in learning markdown stem from my desire to get CST and FSWD students to create writing that can appear in their Github. Why even bother? 

Well, students are expected to add their Github link on their resumes. This way, employers can see student project work, specifically their project code, comments, and contributions. 

This access to student code allows for a more in-depth understanding of the technical skills a student possesses. Cool, right? But what about their non-technical (old skool soft) skills? That's the stuff I teach. Let me explain. 

## The what. My job and students

On every job description, we can see this item:
> must have excellent oral and written communication skills. 

But how to demonstrate these skills, specifically the written part? How have people previously shown written skills when applying for jobs? The resume for starters, the cover letter too. Then, if they get to interview stage, they can talk about the types of docs we have written. 

For my course that includes business correspondence (emails,letters), short reports (progress, incident, recommendations), instruction manuals, and 10-20 page technical problem-solution reports. 

All great, but how does a potential employer get to see that, or even believe that? Why, Github of course! 

But it's easier said than done. Github, with my absolutely limited knowledge, doesn't make it easy for users to upload docs in the common formats my students create: docx or pdf. Much research later, I realize the need to learn and then teach markdown. Markdown files are used in repos, can be turned into HTML, and edited similarly to a word processed doc.

Markdown appears simple....hopefully. FIrst I have to deal with the lack of knowledge of Github, Git, editors, static site generators.....aaaaaargh. Better get the learning on. Time to engage at least one core of the 48-year-old processor that resides in my head.
